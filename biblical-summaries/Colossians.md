## Colossians ##

### Chapter 1 ###
1) Paul and Timothy are addressing the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae..

	“Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.”
	‭‭Colossians‬ ‭1:1-2‬ ‭ESV‬‬

2) Paul hears about their faith in Christ; Love for all saints and praises God..

	“We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints, because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel,”
	‭‭Colossians‬ ‭1:3-5‬ ‭ESV‬‬

3) Epaphras has told the Colossians about the Grace of God in Christ..

	“which has come to you, as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and increasing—as it also does among you, since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth, just as you learned it from Epaphras our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf”
	‭‭Colossians‬ ‭1:6-7‬ ‭ESV‬‬

4) Paul declares the changes wrought by Christ for our good..

	“He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,”
	‭‭Colossians‬ ‭1:13‬ ‭ESV‬‬

**The Preeminence Of Christ**

5) The Preeminence of Christ described:

	1) Image of the invisible God;
	2) Firstborn of all creation;
	3) All things were created by Him, through Him and for Him;
	4) Before all things;
	5) In Him all things hold together;
	6) Head of Church;
	7) The Beginning;
	8) The firstborn from the dead;
	9) All the fullness of God pleased to dwell in Him;
	10) Through Him to reconcile all things to Himself..

	“He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.”
	‭‭Colossians‬ ‭1:15-20‬ ‭ESV‬‬

**Paul's Ministry To The Church**

6) Paul says he is filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the Church (*I personally couldn't fathom fully*)..

	"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church"
	‭‭Colossians‬ ‭1:24 ‭ESV‬‬

7) Talks about his ministry and stewardship from God to make the word of God fully known..

8) To make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of the mystery hidden for ages, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.


### Chapter - 2 ###
1) Tries to encourage them and those at Laodicea and who all have never seen Paul face to face..  

2) Another God's mystery is that in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge..

**Growing In Christ**  

3) Walk, rooted, built up, and established in Him

	“Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.”
	‭‭Colossians‬ ‭2:6-7‬ ‭ESV‬‬

4) Don't fall for human philosophy and tradition..  

5) In Christ dwells the whole deity bodily..  

**Circumcision Of Christ**  

6) In Christ also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ

7) We have been buried with Him in baptism..  

6) God made us alive together with Him having forgiven us all our trespasses by disarming the rulers and principalities at the Cross

	“And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.”
	‭‭Colossians‬ ‭2:13-15‬ ‭ESV‬‬

**Let No One Disqualify You**  

7) Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food, New moon, sabbath, asceticism, worship of angels..

8) If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations - “Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch”

9) These indeed have an appearance of Wisdom but of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh..

	“These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.”
	‭‭Colossians‬ ‭2:23‬ ‭ESV‬‬


### Chapter - 3 ###

**Put On The New Self**

1) If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God..

Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. 	But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. Do not lie to one another.

Put off the old self and put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator

 Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony


**Rules For Christian Households**

	18 Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 
	19 Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them. 
	20 Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.


### Chapter - 4 ###
